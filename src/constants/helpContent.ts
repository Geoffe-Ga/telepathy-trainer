Based on research by Mitch Horowitz and other psi researchers, here are some tips to enhance your practice:

**Before You Begin:**
" Find a quiet space with minimal distractions
" Consider having caffeine beforehandit can enhance focus and sensitivity
" Take 3 deep breaths to center yourself
" Clear your mind of expectations and anxieties

**During Practice:**
" Trust your first impressiondon't second-guess yourself
" Visualize the card appearing in your mind's eye
" Notice any physical sensations, emotions, or mental images that arise
" Stay relaxed but alertneither too tense nor too passive

**For Best Results:**
" Practice daily, even if just for a few minutes
" Consistency matters more than long sessions
" Start with simpler decks (Zener) before moving to complex ones
" Track patterns in your performancelearn when you're most receptive
" Don't get discouraged by missespsychic abilities fluctuate naturally

export const PRACTICE_STRATEGIES = `**Practice Strategies**

**Building Your Ability:**
" Start with Zener cards (5 options, 20% chance)
" Progress to playing cards (52 options, ~2% chance)
" Challenge yourself with Tarot decks (78 options, ~1.3% chance)

**Understanding Your Data:**
" Chance accuracy varies significantly by deck
" Exact matches count toward your streak
" Partial matches (suit OR number) don't break your streak but aren't "hits"
" Look for trends over timesingle sessions can be noisy

**Optimizing Performance:**
" Some people are better at suits, others at numbersdiscover your strength
" Notice which times of day work best for you
" Experiment with different mental/physical states
" The app tracks when you're most accurateuse this data!

**Mental Techniques:**
" **Quiet Mind Method**: Clear all thoughts and wait for an impression
" **Active Visualization**: Mentally "scan" through the deck
" **Intuitive Feeling**: Go with what "feels right"
" **Symbol Association**: Notice if images or feelings arise for certain cards
" **Quick Response**: Sometimes faster guesses work better than deliberation

Try different approaches and see what works for you.`;

export const UNDERSTANDING_RESULTS = `**Understanding Your Results**

**Chance Accuracy by Deck:**
" Zener Cards: 20% (1 in 5)
" Playing Cards: ~1.9% (1 in 52)
" RWS Tarot: ~1.3% (1 in 78)
" Thoth Tarot: ~1.3% (1 in 78)

**What Your Stats Mean:**
" **Exact Match**: Both suit AND number correct (or just suit for Zener)
" **Partial Match**: Either suit OR number correct (not both)
" **Accuracy**: Percentage of exact matches over total guesses
" **Streak**: Consecutive exact matches

**Statistical Significance:**
" Results above chance over many trials may indicate developing ability
" Look for sustained trends, not individual sessions
" Minimum 50-100 guesses before drawing conclusions
" Statistical noise is normalexpect fluctuations

**Time-Based Patterns:**
" The heatmap shows when you're most accurate
" Hour-of-day and day-of-week patterns can emerge
" Some people are more receptive in the morning, others at night
" Use this data to practice during your peak times

**Progress Over Time:**
" The rolling average smooths out daily variations
" Look for upward trends in the chart
" Plateaus are normalabilities develop in jumps
" Keep practicing consistently for best results`;

**Zener Cards (5 cards)**
Created by psychologist Karl Zener for ESP research in the 1930s. The simplest deck with only 5 symbols. No numbers, just suit matching. Best for beginners.

Standard 52-card deck with 4 suits and 13 ranks. A good middle-ground deck that most people are familiar with.

The most popular tarot deck, created in 1909. Includes 22 Major Arcana cards (The Fool through The World) and 56 Minor Arcana cards across 4 suits (Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles).

**Thoth Tarot (78 cards)**
Created by Aleister Crowley and Lady Frieda Harris in the 1940s. Similar structure to RWS but with different symbolism and naming (e.g., "Disks" instead of "Pentacles", "Princess/Prince" instead of "Page/Knight").
